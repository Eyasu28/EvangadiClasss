Q1. Examples of Modus Ponens
   Example1.  "If you have a valid ID, then you can enter the meeting"
               "You have a valid ID"

                Therefore:

                "You enter the meeting"

                  p→q,p


   Example2.    You can't fly to Dubai
                If you have vaccination ID, then you can fly to Dubai

                Therefore

                You don't have a vaccination ID.

                ¬q,p→q






Q2. Curry's Paradox Example
      
         Let π be a sentence of the language of T. A Curry sentence for π and T is any sentence κ such that κ and κ→π are intersubstitutable according to T



Q3. How A rule of inference is related to computer science
         Inference rules are the templates for generating valid arguments. Inference rules are applied to derive proofs in artificial intelligence, and the proof is a sequence of the conclusion that leads to the desired goal.
         In inference rules, the implication among all the connectives plays an important role.

         In artificial intelligence, we need intelligent computers which can create new logic from old logic or by evidence, so generating the conclusions from evidence and facts is termed as Inference.

         Exaple:
            The Wumpus world is a simple world example to illustrate the worth of a knowledge-based agent and to represent knowledge representation. It was inspired by a video game Hunt the Wumpus by Gregory Yob in 1973.

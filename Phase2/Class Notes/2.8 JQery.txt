	- What is jQuery? 
	***************** 

		- jQuery is just a JavaScript library that you include on your web page

		- Means, it is written using JavaScript. The only difference from JavaScript is, it is designed to provide a simpler way of doing things in a more compatible way  

	- Why do we need jQuery?
	************************ 

		- The main reason is to provide a simplified way of handling tasks, that you can normally do with JavaScript. The motto of jQuery is "Write less, do more" 

			- Cross browser compatibility 
				- jQuery uses feature detection to find the best way to do things 

			- Simpler selection method
				- If you use vanilla JavaScript, some methods that you use for selection do not work on older browsers 
		
			- There are simpler ways of doing common tasks 
				- Loop through elements 
				- Add and remove elements 
				- Fade elements 
				- Better event handling 
			
		- It provides a consistent result through out different browsers 

	- What can you do with jQuery? 
	******************************* 

		- Just like JavaScript, there are three main tasks you do with jQuery too 

			- Selecting 
				- Provides simpler and css-like way of selecting 

			- Updating  
				- Multiple jQuery methods provide different ways to update, animate and loop through elements in a much simpler way 

			- Handling events 
				- Allows you to bind events with elements with out the need to write a fall back for older versions 

	- Adding jQuery to your web page 
	********************************* 
		- You can download and put it locally or use a cdn 
		- Add it at the bottom just right before your js file 
		- It is always recommended to use the latest version available 
			- https://code.jquery.com/jquery/
			- https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.js
			- Currently, 3.5.1 is the latest (Dec, 2020)

	- Selecting (Finding elements with jQuery) 
	****************************************** 

		- To find and select an element, you use a function called jQuery(). There is a short hand representation of this method. Instead of typing the whole jQuery(), you can just say $(). 

			jQuery() = $()

		- As you can guess from the name, this is the main and most used function in jQuery. 

		- The jQuery() returns an object of the selected element 

		- To select an element, you can use a CSS-Like selecting method with in the jQuery() method. 

		- Types of selectors 
			- This is very similar with the CSS selectors 
				- Basic selectors 
					- #id 
					- .Class 
					- element
					Ex: 

					- Filters 
						- :first 
						- :last 
						- :even 
						- :odd 
						- :focus
						- :empty
						- :nth-child(2)
						Ex:

					- Content filters
						- :has(selector) -- Checks if element exists in the child and returns the parent 
						
						- :contains("text")
						- :empty
						Ex: 

					- Visibility 
						- :hidden 
						- :visible
						Ex:  

	- Updating values   
	****************

		- jQuery object has many methods that you can use on the element that you select 

		- These are the common methods that you will use 

			- Methods to get or change content of elements, attributes or nodes 
				- Content 
					- html()
					- text()
					- remove()
					Ex:

					Ex: 

	- Handling Events
	*************** 

		- jQuery again makes binding and handling events easier 

		- It uses the on() method to do that 

		- Just like any other method in jQuery, you start by selecting the element you want to respond to. The selection creates a jQuery object that you can use the on() method on

		- Some of the most popular events the on() method deals with are 

		- Note: Each of these events have their own corresponding event binding methods. 
			For example: 
				There is a method called focus() or click() which are used to bind event handlers to the corresponding event 

			- UI Events 	
				- focus, blur, change 
			- Keyboard 
				- keypress, keydown, keyup 
			- Mouse 
				- click, dbclick, mouseout, mouseover
			- Form 
				- submit, change
			- Document
				- ready, load 
			- Browser
				- resize, scroll

				- show()
				- toggle()

	jQuery Plugins
	************** 

		- Plugins are just a collection of additional methods that are written to perform specific tasks which are not already included with the core jQuery code 

		- For example, the fadeIn method is included in the jQuery core. If it were not included and someone decides it is a useful method to have, they could write a plugin that is dependent on the core jQuery. 

		- Means, the newly written method still depends on the jQuery object created by the core. It only adds a feature that is not part of the core 

		- Some of the commonly used jQuery plugins 
			- Gallery 
				- slick 
				- fileUpload 
				- fancyBox

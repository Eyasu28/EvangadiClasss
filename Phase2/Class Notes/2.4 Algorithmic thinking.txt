Algorithms
********** 
  Definition:
    Step-by-step sets of instructions, to complete a task

  Steps to follow when solving algorithmic problem
  ************************************************ 

    1. Understand the problem

    2. Solve it on paper
      - Use example cases to make sure that you can actually solve the problem on paper

        NOTE: The most difficult part for new comers is not actually solving the problem. The difficulty is in understanding & identifying the smallest steps the brain takes to solve the problem. (Our brain is sometimes too fast for us to comprehend)

    3. Craft a general step that can be followed to solve any kind of similar problem

      - This is where you would consider scenarios that might not have been covered in the examples you solve above and tweak the solution accordingly

    4. Write the pseudo code

      - Identify the smallest steps to follow and pick what JavaScript functionality you need to use to cover that step

    5. Translate to JavaScript
      - Follow the pseudo code and write the solution
        - Use all Javascript tools you know
          - Variable
          - Operators
          - function 
          - Conditional statements
          - Loops
          - Arrays
          - All the JS methods you know

    6. Test

  Main things to focus on  
  ***********************
    *** Understand solving the problem in your brain comes before solving it using JavaScript    
    - Understand the main reason why we create a function 
    - Understand what we mean by passing arguments 
    - Understand what calling a function is 
    - Understand how you can simplify human level instructions to the computer's level (Pseudo code)




  Four ways to help you MASTER writing algorithms 

    1. PRACTICE is the only way  

    GOAL: Solve at least 30 problems with in the next 10 days

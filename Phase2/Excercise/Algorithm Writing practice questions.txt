Algorithm writing practice questions
************************************

1. Test divisors of three
  You will be given 2 parameters: a low and high number. Your goal is to print all numbers (on the console) between low and high, and for each of these numbers print whether or not the number is divisible by 3. If the number is divisible by 3, print the word "div3" directly after the number.

2. The famous coding interview question (FizzBuzz)
  Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print â€œFizzâ€ instead of the number and for the multiples of five print â€œBuzzâ€. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

3. Lucky sevens 
  Write a function called lucky_sevens which takes an array of integers and returns true if any three consecutive elements sum to 7.

4. Sum of several arrays
  You will be given an array of several arrays that each contain integers and your goal is to write a function that will sum up all the numbers in all the arrays. For example, if the input is [[3, 2], [1], [4, 12]] then your program should output 22 because3 + 2 + 1 + 4 + 12 = 22.

5. Evens number 
  An Evens number is an integer whose digits are all even. For example 2426 is an Evens number but 3224 is not.
  
  Write a function named isEvens that returns 1 if its integer argument is an Evens number otherwise it returns 0.

6. Magic array
  An array is defined to be a Magic array if the sum of the primes in the array is equal to the first element of the array. If there are no primes in the array, the first element must be 0. So {21, 3, 7, 9, 11 4, 6} is a Magic array because 3, 7, 11 are the primes in the array and they sum to 21 which is the first element of the array. {13, 4, 4, 4, 4} is also a Magic array because the sum of the primes is 13 which is also the first element. Other Magic arrays are {10, 5, 5}, {0, 6, 8, 20} and {3}. {0} is not a Magic array because the sum of the primes is 5+5+3 = 13. Note that -5 is not a prime because prime numbers are positive. 
  
  Write a function named isMagicArray that returns 1 if its integer array argument is a Magic array. Otherwise it returns 0

7. Wave array 
  A wave array is defined to an array which does not contain two even numbers or two odd numbers in adjacent locations. So {7, 2, 9, 10, 5}, {4, 11, 12, 1, 6}, {1, 0, 5} and {2} are all wave arrays. But {2, 6, 3, 4} is not a wave array because the even numbers 2 and 6 are adjacent to each other.
  
  Write a function named isWave that returns 1 if its array argument is a Wave array, otherwise it returns 0.

8. Meera array
  A Meera array is defined to be an array such that for all values n in the array, the value 2*n is not in the array. So {3, 5, -2} is a Meera array because 3*2, 5*2 and -2*2 are not in the array. But {8, 3, 4} is not a Meera array because for n=4, 2*n=8 is in the array. Write a function named isMeera that returns 1 if its array argument is a Meera array. Otherwise it returns 0.

9. Dual array
  Define a Dual array to be an array where every value occurs exactly twice. For example, {1, 2, 1, 3, 3, 2} is a dual array.The following arrays are not Dual arrays {2, 5, 2, 5, 5} (5 occurs three times instead of two times) {3, 1, 1, 2, 2} (3 occurs once instead of two times) Write a function named isDual that returns 1 if its array argument is a Dual array. Otherwise it returns 0.

10. Sort Method 
  Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns another array by sorting the numbers in an acceding order. (In short, write a function that does the same thing the sort() method does)

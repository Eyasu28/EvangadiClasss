Creating HTML pages 
******************* 

  Steps to create an HTML page (.html)   
  ************************************ 

    Step 1: Always create a folder for every project you work on 

      - To do this, go to your favorite working location and create a folder
      - Give the folder a proper name that relates with your project 

    Step 2: Open the folder using your editor (VS) 

    Step 3: Create an HTML document 

      - An HTML document is a simple text file with a .html extension 
      - Save that file with in your working folder 

    Step 4: Define the DOCTYPE  

      - The first line of any HTML document starts by defining the HTML doctype 
      
      - Since we are writing the HTML5 standard, the way to define the doctype is just including the following line at the top of the document 

        <!DOCTYPE html> 

    Step 5: Include the initial HTML boiler tags 

      - These boiler tags are the ones which are part of every HTML document 
      - It includes the <html>, <head> and <body> tags. 
      - Make sure all of them are closed properly 
        - Tip: Visual Studio can help you create these quickly 

    Step 6: Give title for your document 
      
      - This is defined with in the <title> tag under the <head> section 
      - At this point, you would have a starter HTML document ready 

    Step 7: Start including the contents to your document 

      - The main content of your HTML document is included with in the <body> tag 

      - Always start by including an <h1> tag 
        - <h1> is the main header tag used as the main title of your document 
        - This header is different form the title you already included inside the <title> tag 
        - An HTML document is suppose to have only a single <h1> tag. If you want to include more headings, use the <h2> - <h6> 

      - All the other tags you use are dependent on the type of content you want to include
